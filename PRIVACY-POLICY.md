# Privacy Policy for Alder AI Security Agent

Last Updated: May 5th, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Alder AI ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with the Alder AI Security Agent GitHub Action (the "Action").

## Information We Process

The Action requires access to your source code repository to perform security analysis. However:

*   **Code Content:** Your source code is processed ephemerally for the duration of the analysis. **We do not store your source code.** The analysis is performed using Large Language Models (LLMs). Your code is **not** used to train these models.
*   **Repository Metadata:** We may process minimal metadata about your repository (e.g., repository name, commit hashes) as necessary to initiate and report the results of the scan. This metadata is not stored long-term.
*   **Vulnerability Findings:** Security reports generated by the Action are typically uploaded as artifacts to your repository or displayed in the workflow logs. **We do not store these reports on our systems.**
*   **API Key:** Your Alder AI API key is used solely for authentication and billing purposes related to scan credits. It is processed securely and is not logged in detail.

## How We Use Information

The information processed by the Action is used solely for the purpose of:

*   Performing the requested security analysis on your codebase.
*   Authenticating your request using the provided API key.
*   Associating scan usage with your purchased credits for billing.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your source code, repository metadata, or vulnerability findings with third parties, except as necessary to operate the underlying LLM infrastructure required for the analysis. Our contracts with infrastructure providers prohibit them from storing or using your code for their own purposes, including model training.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information processed by the Action during transit and analysis. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## User Control

You control when the Action runs by configuring your GitHub Actions workflows. You manage the storage and access permissions for any generated security reports (artifacts) within your own GitHub repository settings.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
